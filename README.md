# Class Lectures

These are the class lectures designed for and used in the restructured
CS 340 course (beginning Fall 2019).

## Usage

Each lecture folder contains a 'Pre-class' file that explains the work that
should be completed before the lecture. Additionally, the lecture
folders contain exercises that are to be completed following the
lecture.
